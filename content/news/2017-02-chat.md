title: "Add Gitter chat"
---

We add the realtime chat-system [Gitter](http://gitter.im) to our project to get into contact with you. <!--more-->

We would like to get any information about your projects and any suggestions to developing LightJason. We try to help you in any kind of problems, because we are new and we can optimize our system with your help, so don't be shy and feel free to ask. __You can find the chat on each website on the bottom-right corner__.

We can optimize your system only if you send us feedback...
