We joined the [Docker-Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lightjason/) community with LightJason. <!--more-->

Our (minimal) pre-built docker container contains a Java development environment with the latest [AgentSpeak(L++) developer build](https://hub.docker.com/r/lightjason/agentspeak/).
The `lightjason/agentspeak` container consists of

* [Linux Alpine 3.7](https://alpinelinux.org/)
* Glibc & Git
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Oracle Java 9 Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)

The container is public, so we welcome everyone to extend or fork it.
Updates in the [AgentSpeak(L++) repository](https://github.com/LightJason/AgentSpeak) will automatically trigger container updates.
We plan to set up different versions of this container when the first release is finished.

*Update 2018-02-09:* LightJason now uses (and requires) Java 1.9; updated JDK link.
