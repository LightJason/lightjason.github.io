Update [actions](/knowledgebase/builtinactions) and [agent cycle](/knowledgebase/differencetojason) description within the knowledge base. <!--more-->

The agent cycle images allows you to use a _mouse over effect_ to highlight elements. The action list links to the source code documentation. We will append the description of the actions soon.
