We added a [simulation wizard](/tutorials/wizard) to the website, which can be used to create a full working project zip file, with the source codes of a multi-agent simulation.
<!--more--> 

The wizard allows you to define the base structure of a multi-agent simulation and generates on the current developer AgentSpeak version a project, which can build directly into an executable jar file. 
We have tested the wizard-generated source with communication, environment, internal and external actions up to 2.500.000 agents on a normal office computer.
