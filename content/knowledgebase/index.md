In this Section we provide basic knowledge helpful for understanding the theoretical concepts and [practical tutorials](/tutorial) of our framework.

1. [Logical Programming](basic-logicalprogramming) for understanding the difference to imperative programming. Explanation of the basic concepts for using this paradigm to describe the agent behaviour
2. [Finite-State-Machine](basic-finitestatemachine) for understanding the runtime model of the agent behaviour
3. [Finite-State-Machine & Logical Programming to an Agent](basic-fsm-logical-to-agent) to understand how we combine the parts into our agent definition
4. [Actions](basic-actions) explanation of all built-in actions
