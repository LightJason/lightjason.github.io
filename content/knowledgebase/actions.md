This text gives you an overview over the main build-in actions in LightJason/AgentSpeak(L++).

All actions are organised within the [action.buildin](http://lightjason.github.io/AgentSpeak/sources/d8/da4/namespaceorg_1_1lightjason_1_1agentspeak_1_1action_1_1buildin.html) package. Each packages defines a semantic structure of the actions.
For an example on how to make use of actions have a look at our [testing agent](https://github.com/LightJason/AgentSpeak/blob/master/src/test/resources/agent/complete.asl) which uses many built-in actions provided by AgentSpeak(L++).
