This project arises during our PhD time, because our research is along [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system). Our research projects consider with _traffic_ and _crowd simulation_, but we try to simulation complex _behaviour of human behaviour_.

Malte's research depends on _complex overtaking manoeuvre_ and _norm usage_ with modelling on a high abstraction level. Philipp's research is the _high scalibibly_ of such complex simulation system also with data maining / big data and software developing aspects. Based on these point of views we can amend our work.

Our work is inspired by [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/), a multi-agent framework, which is developed by Jomi F. Hübner and Rafael H. Bordini, but cannot ported for your requirements. We had tried a lot different types of create an usable system for our simulation contents, but we can't, so we build-up our framework from scratch.
