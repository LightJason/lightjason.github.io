We started this project as part of our Ph.D. work, because our research deals with [multi-agent systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system).
Our research projects consider _traffic_ and _crowd simulation_, and we try to simulate more _more complex human-like behaviour_.

Based on these perspectives, we can motivate our work.
Our work is inspired by [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/), a multi-agent framework developed by Jomi F. Hübner and Rafael H. Bordini, wich we didn't use due to conflicts with our requirements. Instead we based our work on some of their theoretical concepts and ideas.

We tried a lot of different types of frameworks like [TerraME](http://www.terrame.org/), [FLAME](http://www.flame.ac.uk/), [GOAL](http://ii.tudelft.nl/trac/goal) or [MASON](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) to create an usable system for our simulation, but without success, so that we build up our framework from scratch.

From another point of view, we had compared the main _popular programming language indices_ [Tiobe](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2016/02/19/language-rankings-1-16/) and [PopularitY](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in 2015 / 2016 and we found out, that agent-programming languages are not listed on any index, only _logical programming (Prolog)_ is found on Tiobe.
Our goal for this system is to create a practically usable and well documented framework which can also be used by non-software-developers and included in already existing projects. We try to explain the ideas, concepts and technical background in a clean and understandable way to get a better approval of agent-programming and modelling.
